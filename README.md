## Installation Guide

### Software Requirements

Download and install the following software:

- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) (Comes with Apache, PHP, and MySQL bundled)
- Any Chromium Browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, etc.)

### VSCode Extensions

- PHP Server by brapifra (Required)
- php cs fixer by junstyle (Required)
- Live Server by Ritwick Dey (Optional)
- GitHub Copilot (Recommended - Students get free GitHub Pro)

### GitHub

Pretty obvious but you need to have a GitHub account. For GitHub Copilot, you need to get GitHub Pro which is free for students. However, GitHub will ask for document verification which may take 2-3 business days.

Once that is done, fork this repository first and then clone it to your local machine.

### XAMPP

You will not be needing XAMPP immediately to run the boiler plate code. However, you will need it to run the PHP server and MySQL database in the future. Here is an quick look. Just clicking the first two buttons will do the job. No need for complex MySQL or Docker setups.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Install XAMPP in the root directory of your C: drive. Please the PHP directory to user PATH during or after installation. In some cases, you may need to add to VSCode settings as well. It would be `C:\xampp\php`.

### Running the Code
Go to the `index.php` file in the project folder after you have cloned the repository. Right click and select `Open with Live Server`. This will open the file in your default browser.

You should see a green themed GradePlus website with the signup sheet. If you see that, you are good to go.
